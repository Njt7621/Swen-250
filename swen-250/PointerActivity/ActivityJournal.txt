Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	1HH MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
1. Complete read_data.h following the requirments:
 * The calling sequence has three arguments:
 *      - a pointer to a char variable.
 *      - a pointer to an int variable.
 *      - a pointer to a double precision variable.
 *
 * The routine
 *      1. Reads the three fields into local variables (using getchar()),
 *      2. Converts the two numeric fields from ASCII strings to numbers:
 *              a) Use atoi for the integer.
 *              b) Use atof for the double.
 *      3. Uses the parameter pointers to store the three values in variables
 *         declared in the caller, and
 *      4. Returns.


2. Complete read_data.c following the requirments:
* Reads the three fields from lines such as W$1349$1.414$ into
* local variables using getchar().
* Converts the two numeric fields to numbers using atoi for the
* integer fields and atof for the double.
* Using a correctly defined set of parameters (use pointers) pass
* those values back to the program that called this function.


3. Complete main.c following the requirments:
 *      1. Declares local variables for the character, integer, and
 *         double precision values returned by read_data.
 *      2. Calls read_data with pointers to the variables so that
 *         the values read can be returned.
 *      3. On return, prints the character, integer, and double
 *         precision number using the following format string for
 *         printf:
 *              "Character %c Integer %d Floating point %.4f\n"
 *         Note: you must also, of course, provide the values to
 *         be printed.
 *      4. Return a 0 to the operating system.


4. Ask for help, use notes and the internet.
