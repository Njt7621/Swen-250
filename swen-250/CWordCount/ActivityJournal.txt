================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time 1HH MM
Plan: Program reads file(s)than prints:
  -number of lines
  -number of words
  -number of characters
Testing approach:
  -make one function that uses a for loop to counts each time it
 gets a line, word, and character.
  -probably store these things in an array and add 1 for the Nul
Order of implementation:
  -not sure yet. Probably starting by equaling everything to zero.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	1HH 30MM
Observations: Problems encountered when compile:
  -used colon instead of semi colon
  -forgot nchar in front of != EOF
Obstacles to over come:
  -got 0 for line and word but 375 for character
  -changed for loop into while statement
  -add appropriate amount of spaces to match statement
Lessons learned:
  -try changing the code
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
